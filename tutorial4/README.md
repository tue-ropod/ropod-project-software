### Models in models in ...

We can even go one step further. Imagine I have a set of entities that always show up together, or, in other words, a model that **consists** of other models. A practical example is the model specification of a certain environment, *e.g.* your robot lab. Such a robot lab consists of walls, tables, etc. We can use **composition** to include models inside models.

An example. Assume we want to create a model called robot-lab. And let's say this robot lab contains walls and two tables of which we've specified the model above. Then we can create a directory called 'robot-lab' and put the following in its 'model.yaml':

    composition:
    - id: table1
      type: table
      pose: { x: 2, y: 0, z: 0 }
    - id: table2
      type: table
      pose: { x: 3, y: 2, z: 0, Z: 1.54 }
    - id: walls
      shape:
        heightmap:
          image: $(file my-walls.pgm)
          height: 2
          resolution: 0.025
          pose: { x: -10.0, y: -10.0, z: 0 }

Don't forget to put the 'my-walls.pgm' in the 'robot-lab' model directory! Now we have specified a model which includes other models. Our configuration file can be as simple as:

    world:
    - type: robot-lab
      pose: { x: 0, y: 0, z: 0 }

    plugins:
      - name: gui_server
        lib: libed_gui_server_plugin.so

Run ED and visualize the world model. You should see two tables and some walls, as specified by your heightmap.
